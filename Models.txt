Models
  At least three pages for each model
  Must have a grid or table for each model, which contain links to the instances of a model
  Need to show at least five attributes of the model, these attributes must be filterable or sortable
  Grid/table page must show total number of instances and pages
  Each instance needs to contain connections to the other model instances
  Each instance must have at least 2 forms of media
  Do not need to implement sorting/filtering for this phase. Simply need to have  attributes that are filterable/sortable
