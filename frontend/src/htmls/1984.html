        "It is 1984, and the worlds' three major powers-Oceania, Eurasia and
        Eastasia-are constantly at war. In Oceania, where the Party is in power,
        the thought police unearth every act of dissent, and Big Brother is
        always watching. Winston Smith, a dutiful citizen of Oceania, works for
        the Ministry of Truth as a propaganda writer who rewrites history to
        suit the needs of the authoritarian government. But when Winston falls
        in love with fellow worker Julia, they begin to question the very system
        they work for, placing them in immense danger. Pursuing their forbidden
        love affair, Winston plans a rebellion against the Party in order to
        regain the freedom to shape his own future. But the ever-watchful Big
        Brother will not tolerate opposition, and for those who speak up against
        the system or dare to think what the Party does not want them to think,
        Room 101 awaits them . . . 1984 is George Orwell's haunting prophesy of
        the future, which has held multiple generations of readers spellbound in
        its chilling and terrifying vision of life under a totalitarian regime.
        Powerful and unforgettable, this still-relevant novel explores the
        obliteration of truth, individuality and liberty in a world where the
        ruling power seeks to control everything, from information to thought
        and memory."
