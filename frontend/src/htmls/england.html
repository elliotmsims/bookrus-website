        England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom.[6][7][8] It
        shares land borders with Wales to its west and Scotland to its north.
        The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea to the
        southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea
        to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers
        five-eighths of the island of Great Britain, which lies in the North
        Atlantic, and includes over 100 smaller islands, such as the Isles of
        Scilly and the Isle of Wight. The area now called England was first
        inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Paleolithic period, but
        takes its name from the Angles, a Germanic tribe deriving its name from
        the Anglia peninsula, who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries.
        England became a unified state in the 10th century and has had a
        significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world since the Age
        of Discovery, which began during the 15th century.[9] The English
        language, the Anglican Church, and English law—the basis for the common
        law legal systems of many other countries around the world—developed in
        England, and the country's parliamentary system of government has been
        widely adopted by other nations.[10] The Industrial Revolution began in
        18th-century England, transforming its society into the world's first
        industrialised nation.[11] England's terrain is chiefly low hills and
        plains, especially in central and southern England. However, there is
        upland and mountainous terrain in the north (for example, the Lake
        District and Pennines) and in the west (for example, Dartmoor and the
        Shropshire Hills). The capital is London, which has the largest
        metropolitan area in the United Kingdom. England's population of 56.3
        million comprises 84% of the population of the United Kingdom,[4]
        largely concentrated around London, the South East, and conurbations in
        the Midlands, the North West, the North East, and Yorkshire, which each
        developed as major industrial regions during the 19th century.[12] The
        Kingdom of England – which after 1535 included Wales – ceased being a
        separate sovereign state on 1 May 1707, when the Acts of Union put into
        effect the terms agreed in the Treaty of Union the previous year,
        resulting in a political union with the Kingdom of Scotland to create
        the Kingdom of Great Britain.[13][14] In 1801, Great Britain was united
        with the Kingdom of Ireland (through another Act of Union) to become the
        United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922 the Irish Free
        State seceded from the United Kingdom, leading to the latter being
        renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.[15]
